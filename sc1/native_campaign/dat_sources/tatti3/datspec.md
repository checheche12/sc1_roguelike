# Versions
Major version should be 1. Plan is to increment if there are breaking changes in format (never)

Minor version is currently 7. It gets incremented when the editor should automatically once write
some default values that the user can edit afterwards.

## Minor version changes
- V2 Adds default dummy reqs (Is Landed building) for spread creep (0x66) and place addon (0x24)
    orders.dat, necessary since tatti doesn't make distinction between no reqs enabled and no reqs
    disabled.
- V3 Fixes place addon req from "Is Landed building" to "Has no Addon"
    (Lifted off buildings couldn't build addons)
- V4 Changes reserved unit ids to use 0xe4 for subunit 1/2/infestation, sight to 1,
    orders to 23, weapons to 130.
- V5 Adds No cloak aggression ext unit flag to ghost units
- V6 Adds ext unit flags 0x18, 0x20
- V7 Adds max energy upgrades
- V8 Adds ext unit flag 0x40
- V9 Adds ext unit flag 0x4
- V10 Adds ext unit flags 0x80, 0x100, 0x200, 0x400, and AI building guards

# Field flags

The only flags that are currently defined are that for fields that have single integer value per
entry, masking `flags & 0x3` is used to define the entry size.
- 0x0 u8
- 0x1 u16
- 0x2 u32
- 0x3 u64 (Not really supported)

# Fields

How to parse the field data differs from field id to another (See below for list).

The formats that have been defined are:

### Single integer
The most common format. Requires checking value of `flags & 3` to determine exact size of each entry

```
SingleIntegerField:
flags & 0x3:
- 0x0 u8 data[entry_count]
- 0x1 u16 data[entry_count]
- 0x2 u32 data[entry_count]
- 0x3 u64 data[entry_count] (Not really supported)
```

Note: The vanilla .dat format has some entries where array size is less than entry count,
such as units.dat infestation being only defined for ids 106 to 228. These kind of subsets
aren't supported; existing undersized fields get expanded to have a value for each entry.

### Multiple integers
E.g. Unit dimension box, where the data is `u16[entry_count * 2]` containing width and height
for each unit. The flags may be set to match the integer width like in `Single integer` format,
but it can be assumed that a specific `Multiple integers` field has always same integer width
that the list below specifies.

### Dat requirement offset, Dat requirement buffer
Dat requirements are represented in format that BW expects them to be: If offset is 0, the
requirement is "Disabled", otherwise it is an index to the buffer of u16-sized requirement opcodes
(NOTE: in u16s, not bytes), which is terminated with 0xffff. The opcode reference is at end
of this file.

This dat format uses one field to store the buffer offset (Using the vanilla field id that BW kind of
does support but is left 0xffff for every unit), and a second field (with a new id) to store the
buffer.

### Variable length list
The requirement buffers with 0xffff-terminated lists are bit awkward to work with, so any
extended dat needing variable length lists will use the following format where two fields
are used to contain offset and length, to one or more buffers.

The offset/length fields use `Single integer` format - check field flags for integer width.
Buffer fields are also `Single integer` format, using `flags & 0x3` to determine width, their
entry count just isn't tied to dat entry count.

If the list has more complex structure than single integer, the same offset and length are
used to index to multiple sibling buffers.

#### List example
Upgrade effects for upgrade ids `#0`, `#1`, `#2`, all affecting unit 55
- `#0` has 3 effects:
    * Movement speed +50% from level 1
    * Movement speed +25% from level 2
    * Attack speed from level 3
 - `#1` has 1 effect:
    * Attack speed from level 1 that is removed at level 3
 - `#3` has 2 effects:
    * Attack speed from level 1
    * Movement speed -50% from level 1, removed at level 2
See list later on for details on how the integers are interpreted

```
Offsets (id 0x14) [0, 3, 4]
Lengths (id 0x15) [3, 1, 2]
Effect Types (Id 0x16) [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Effect Min levels (Id 0x17) [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1]
Effect Max levels (Id 0x18) [255, 255, 255, 3, 255, 2]
Effect units (Id 0x19) [55, 55, 55, 55, 55, 55]
Effect values (Id 0x1a) [512, 256, 0, 0, 0, -512]
```

## Field forward compatibility note
Dat files written with older versions of a program may not have every extended field that are
listed below. Anybody accessing extended fileds should have a reasonable fallback values in such case.
Vanilla fields should always exist.

## List of fields and their formats

Any field that has no comment describing its format is in `Single integer` format.
